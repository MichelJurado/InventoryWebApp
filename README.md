# InventoryWebApp

This app is to demonstrate a simple way of tracking inventory. For the example I used fruits. When a user purchases a fruit the sql query will reduce the inventory count while at the same time increasing the count of the Fruits Sold table. This app also was created to showcase how to place images in a sql table and call them from blazor using dapper.
